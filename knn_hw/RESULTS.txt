1) Program Usage

The directory this file resides in is the top level directory for an eclipse project  
if you wish to run it that way.

The program takes two arguments:
1) The gene relation data file
2) The gene relation test file

As I have it set in my eclipse the arguments are:
.//hw2_files//Genes_relation.data .//hw2_files//Genes_relation.test


Otherwise the command line usage should be:
java KNNText genes_relation.text genes__relation.test


2)  Classifier Method

I used a simple but slightly modified version of KNN to classify my data. 
When the GeneID's of the test element matches the GeneID of a gene
in the training set I simply classify the localization of the test element
as being the same as the training set element's.

Otherwise I weight the Essential, Class, Complex, Phenotype, Motif
and Chromosome Number columns equally and reduce the distance
between the test element and the training set element by equal amounts
for each of them.

I classify the test element using the 10 nearest neighbours.


3) Handling Missing Data

I calculated the mode of the existing data elements for all elements
except GeneID, Function and Localization because they had no missing values.

4) Solution Accuracy

Total rows tested: 1929
Correctly labelled localizations: 715
Percentage labelled correctly: 0.37065837221358217
